Based on the critique, V11's prompt should be:

"Please revise the n8n workflow "Ultimate_Workflow_V10" with the following improvements:

1. Include documentation explaining the purpose of the webhook in this workflow and what event is expected to trigger it.
2. Replace the placeholder URL "https://api.example.com/data" in the HTTP Request node with the actual URL you want to request data from. Include any required headers or parameters.
3. Clarify the use of the "processed" status in the Set Node. If it's being used in the Supabase Insert node, ensure that the "events" table in your Supabase database has a "status" column.
4. In the Supabase Insert node, specify what data you are inserting into the "events" table by adding a "values" parameter.
5. Incorporate error handling nodes to provide fallback or retry logic in case any of the nodes fail.
6. Consider renaming the workflow to something more descriptive to clearly indicate its function."
