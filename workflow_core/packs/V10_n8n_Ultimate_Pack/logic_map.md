Creating a logic map for a complex enterprise n8n automation pack would depend on the specific functionalities and processes involved in the enterprise. Here's a general example:

1. Start
2. Get data: This could be from various sources like email, forms, databases, CRM, etc.
3. Data Validation: Check if the data is complete and valid.
4. Decision Point: Is the data valid?
    - Yes: Proceed to the next step.
    - No: Send an error notification and end the process.
5. Data Processing: Process the data according to the business rules. This could be calculations, data transformation, etc.
6. Decision Point: Is the data processing successful?
    - Yes: Proceed to the next step.
    - No: Send an error notification and end the process.
7. Data Storage: Store the processed data in the database or any other storage system.
8. Data Sync: Sync the data with other systems if necessary, like CRM, ERP, etc.
9. Notification: Send a notification about the completion of the process.
10. Error Handling: In case of any errors at any step, handle the error and send a notification.
11. End

Please note that this is a very general logic map and the actual map could vary significantly based on the specific enterprise n8n automation pack.
