Creating a logic map for a complex enterprise n8n automation pack involves outlining the step-by-step process and data flow of the automation system. Here's a basic example of how it might look:

1. Start Node: This is the starting point of the automation process. It could be an event trigger like receiving an email or a scheduled event.

2. Condition Node: This node will evaluate certain conditions. For example, if the email received contains certain keywords or if the scheduled event is on a specific date.

3. Action Node: Depending on the conditions evaluated, this node will perform a certain action. This could be anything from sending a response email, updating a database, or triggering another process.

4. Decision Node: This node decides what the next step should be based on the results of the previous actions. 

5. Loop Node: This node is used when an action needs to be repeated multiple times. For example, sending emails to all contacts in a list.

6. Integration Node: This node connects to external systems or applications. For example, it might integrate with a CRM system to update customer data or with a cloud storage system to save files.

7. Error Handling Node: This node manages any errors that occur during the process. It might send an alert or try to correct the error.

8. End Node: This is the final step of the automation process. It might involve sending a completion notification or generating a report.

This is a basic structure and the actual logic map might be much more complex depending on the specific needs of the enterprise. It's also important to note that n8n has a visual workflow builder which makes it easier to create and understand the logic map.
